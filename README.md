# arduino-ifttt
This code simply triggers the IFTTT maker chanel using an arduino and an ethernet shield

The main thing you have to do to make it work, is to get an Ethernet Shield and to replace the XXXXXXX with your IFTTT trigger and key.

You may also want to comment the debugging part and update the MAC.
